Project for CS5500 course NEU
Created a web application that will read an excel file, and check the errors based on the rules defined. The error rules are based on the SQL data format i.e., data type, character limits on a table column, etc. If an error rule returns true, a page with a list of cells with row and column numbers, and error descriptions are shown.

Developed the application using Spring boot MVC, Thyme leaf, and MySQL.
